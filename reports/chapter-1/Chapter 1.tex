\subsection{Background of Study}
\subsection{Problem Statement}
Farmers need information concerning the state of their farms in order to know what they are to do to achieve high crop yields and have high productivity in their farms. The problem has been that farmers especially in africa have not had access to accurate and real-time information concerning their farms. There some countries that use satellite monitoring to monitor their farms, however studies have shown that this method has got some limitations too. This is mainly due to the fact that the satellites are not able to gather granular information concerning the conditions of their farms.
