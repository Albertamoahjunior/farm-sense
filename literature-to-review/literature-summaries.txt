1. Le and Tan (2015) from Long An University of Economics and Industry presented a project utilizing Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) to monitor agricultural parameters. Their system deploys sensor nodes in cultivation areas, transmitting data to a management node, then to a control center and server via the internet. This setup enables farmers to observe field conditions, make informed decisions, and ensure production quality. The extensible system enhances precision agriculture by providing real-time field information.

This setup enables real-time tracking of soil conditions, facilitating automated irrigation when temperature or moisture thresholds are exceeded. Sensors measure parameters relayed to a microcontroller, which regulates water flow based on programmed logic. Implemented for 'Smart Irrigation Application' using RF 433MHz modules, the system offers both automated and manual irrigation options based on collected data.g system.
